// this is a classic example of NaN
let demo = "1234abc" // this string contains both number and letters, let's convert to number
let converted = Number(demo) // here it will convert

// numbers can be converted into numbers
// strings + numbers can't be converted into numbers
// true and false can be converted into numbers resulting 1 and 0
